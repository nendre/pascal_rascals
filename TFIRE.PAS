This is kinda funny... just the other day I was looking at Jare's fire
code, and did an 80x50 textmode version of it in C.  I did a quick and
dirty conversion of it to Pascal so I could post it here for you
(don't you feel special? <G>).  The pascal version came out a bit
slower then my C version, although they are very similar. I haven't
figured out why though... most times I try this, both come out close
to the same speed.

 Fire by Eric Coolman (aka. Digitar/SKP), Simple Minded Software
 Much like Jare's (VangelisTeam) fire, but uses 80x50x16 text mode
 rather than 320x200x256 (which was "tweaked" to look like 80x50
 text mode).  Reference : FIRE.TXT by Phil Carlisle (aka Zoombapup,
 CodeX) from PC Game Programmer's Encyclopedia (PCGPE10.ZIP) by Mark
 Feldman and contributers (thanks for the great reads guys!).
 Compiler : Turbo Pascal 6.0
 Released to public domain, July 30, 1994.

 NOTE: FirePalette will not get loaded if running under DESQview
       with "VIRTUALIZE TEXTMODE" on (which will stop any palette
       manipulation).  To fix, go into setup for the DOSBOX, and
       under "VIRTUALIZE TEXT/GRAPHICS" mode, and set it to "N".
       Also for DV, set "WRITES DIRECT TO SCREEN" to "Y"es.

 sets only color indexes normally used in textmode (16 of 'em).
 Note the heavy use of ternary operator there... what that means
 is - indexes 7 to 15 (dark gray to white) are actually indexes
 55 to 63, and index 6 (dark brown) is actually 20d (14h) because
 it uses the secondary hues so that it doesn't look too much like
 red.  The rest (0,1,2,4,5,7) are as expected.
